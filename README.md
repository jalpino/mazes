#Mazes

This project is an experiment in maze generation using Coldfusion. A lot of credit goes
to [Jamis Buck](https://github.com/jamis) and his [fantastic blog posts](http://weblog.jamisbuck.org/)
on Maze Generation in helping me learn and understand how to apply various mathematical algorithms
to produce mazes.

This project implements the Backtracking Algorithm (both in recursive and iterative form) and
Kruskal's algorithm.

The code has been tested on Railo 3.1 and Railo 3.2.
